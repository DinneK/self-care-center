# Self Care Center
## Introduction
  - This project was designed for us to gain experience using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I created the skeleton of the
  Self Care Center application by utilizing HTML, then I began to style this application using CSS and employing
  flex box. Lastly, I used JavaScript to make the application functional. I adjusted the HTML, CSS and JavaScript as
  I moved through features in order to sustain the original design.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS


## Illustrations
  - meditate.svg, `alt='Meditating Human'`

## Features
- Finished comp card
- Radio buttons, representing 'Affirmations' and 'Mantras'.
- Message button causing the Meditating Human icon to disappear.

**The Choose Your Own Adventure 1**
- User should not be able to click the “Receive Message” button unless they have selected a message option.
- The user can click a clear button, which clears the page of any message.
- User should only be able to click the clear button if a message is visible.
- When the clear button is clicked and the message is removed, the image of the meditation icon should re-appear.
- If you’ve added other buttons or inputs, be sure to add some error handling for them as well.

**The Choose Your Own Adventure 2**
*Intermediate CSS*
- Do some research and determine how to make your app respond to the user’s screen size.
- Layout and spacing should adapt to mobile, tablet, desktop and extra large screens
- Add a loading animation when a user clicks the “Receive Message” button to simulate searching for a message. Hint - You will need to use CSS Keyframes, and a Javascript timeout function for this.
- Make your buttons grow in size or change color when the user hovers over them, enticing them to click the dang thing.
- When the message appears, the text should fade in, from white to black to deliver the message in a calming way.
- Have the background change depending on if a user has selected an affirmation or mantra. Choose a calming secondary gradient for - each type of message.

## Possible Future Extensions
  - A login page would be super cool, if it were responsive in a sense of allowing users login to be saved/recipe ideas they like to be stored within their page.
  - Adding in transitions via CSS would have appreciated.
